Qirat ‚Äì AI-Powered Quran Recitation & Memorization App
Tech Stack: MERN Stack, Tailwind CSS (In Progress)
Focus: Voice Recognition, Personalized Recitation Feedback

üìå Description
Qirat is a personal Quran recitation and memorization assistant built to address a real-life problem:
Many individuals, especially in busy households, find it difficult to recite the Quran to a qualified teacher (Ustad) for correction. This often leads to reciting incorrectly or losing motivation to memorize due to lack of feedback.

This idea originated from conversations in my neighborhood, where people shared the challenge of not having anyone to listen to and correct their recitation. While researching, I found an app called Tarteel that offers similar features‚Äîbut only for paid users.

Inspired by this gap, I decided to build Qirat as a completely free and accessible platform where users can:

- Recite the Quran verse-by-verse

- Get instant feedback using voice recognition

- If a verse is recited correctly, it is displayed normally

- If a verse is recited incorrectly, it appears highlighted in red

- Track memorization progress without needing a teacher

In short, Qirat acts like a "pocket Ustad", helping users recite and memorize the Quran with real-time corrections‚Äîanytime, anywhere.

This project is fully self-built, with no external resources or team, driven purely by passion and a desire to make learning the Quran more accessible. Through this journey, I‚Äôve not only grown as a software developer but also personally, by solving a meaningful problem through technology.
